        "**Game Rules:** Make a prediction. The host, Monty Hall, will open all loosing doors excluding your choice. This leaves two doors: the door you selected and a door that could also have the prize. You are given the chance to change your selection before the host reveals the winning door. You will either bust or win the car based on your final selection.  \n",

        "**Strategies:** There are two strategies to apply in this game:  \n",
        "> 1) **Stick with your first choice.** You always turn down the chance to change your answer.  \n",
        "> 2) **Change your answer.** When given the chance to change your answer, you always take that option.   \n",

        "**Task:** Determine which is the best strategy. Demonstrate the best strategy using: \n",
